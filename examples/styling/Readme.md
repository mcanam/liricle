# Styling Example  

This example demonstrates how to apply custom styling to components in **Liricle**.  

## Overview  
**Liricle** is a headless library, meaning it does not provide any built-in user interface (UI) by default. Instead, it focuses on core functionality, allowing developers the freedom to define and implement their own UI.  

In this example, we show how you can:  
1. Apply styles using CSS.  
2. Integrate Liricle seamlessly into your custom UI.  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `examples/styling` folder:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/mcanam/liricle.git  
   cd liricle/examples/styling  
   ```  

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser or run a local server:  
   ```bash  
   npx http-server  
   ```  

3. Follow the comments in the code for further details on styling customization.  

## Why Styling Matters  
Because Liricle is headless, the look and feel of your application are entirely in your hands. This example serves as a starting point to help you design and style a UI that complements the library's functionality.  

Refer to the main documentation for more information on customization capabilities.
